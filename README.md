# Delete Empty Decks
I created this Anki Addon that will delete empty decks. This is useful if you use filtered decks to study when you're doing Anki. Works well with this addon: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/104518886. After you do all your filtered decks, you can press the empty all button, then go into tools and press the delete empty decks.
